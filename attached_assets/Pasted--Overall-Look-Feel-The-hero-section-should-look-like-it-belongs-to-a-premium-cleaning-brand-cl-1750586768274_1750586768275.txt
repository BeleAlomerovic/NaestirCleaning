🔹 Overall Look & Feel
The hero section should look like it belongs to a premium cleaning brand — clean, calm, confident. Think: Apple’s design sensibility mixed with the friendliness of a hospitality brand.

Color Scheme: A soft, minimal background — either a pale lavender gradient or a very light gray with purple undertones. Avoid any high-contrast or emoji-like visuals.
Layout: Center-aligned content with generous white space. This keeps the focus on your message without clutter.
🔹 Typography
Your headline is strong — but refine the style to appear more elegant and premium.

Main Headline:
Use a large, modern serif or clean bold sans-serif font:
“A Cleaner Home, A Brighter You.”
The first half ("A Cleaner Home") in a dark neutral color (like charcoal)
The second half ("A Brighter You") in your brand purple — subtle, not neon
Subtext:
“We clean. You breathe.” in a soft italic, grayish tone for contrast and a gentle voice.
🔹 Buttons (Call to Action)
Replace the emoji-style buttons with sleek, professional ones.

Primary Button:
“Get Your Free Quote”
Solid dark purple background
White bold text
Rounded corners, with soft shadow on hover
Secondary Button:
“See Our Services”
Transparent background
Purple border
Same shape as the main button but with a minimalist, outlined look
Both buttons should feel tactile but subtle — not playful.

🔹 Trust Statement (Below the Buttons)
Instead of using emoji bullets, keep it professional:

Trusted by 2,000+ happy clients • Eco-friendly • Insured & Vetted Staff
Use simple dot dividers (•), soft gray text, and smaller font size. Keep it clean and understated.

🔹 Background
Avoid bright or busy imagery. Choose one of the following:

A light gradient background (lavender fading into white)
Or a subtle background image: a clean space with extremely low opacity or blur — more as a texture than a photo.
This makes the section feel modern and calming.

🔹 Spacing & Composition
Ample padding around each element to give a sense of airiness
Headline → Subheadline → Buttons → Trust line — each spaced thoughtfully
On desktop, everything should sit in the vertical center of the screen
On mobile, stack elements cleanly with even more padding between them
